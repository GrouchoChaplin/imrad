# ImRAD

ImRAD is a GUI builder for the ImGui library. It generates and parses C++ code. 

ImRAD runs on Windows and Linux. 

# Features
ImRAD is under development but these are the main features at least partially completed:
* supports wide range of widgets
* generates layout using SameLine/Spacing/NextColumn/BeginGroup so code stays more readable than by using direct cursor positioning
* supports property binding. Variables can be managed through simple class wizard or from binding dialog
* supports generating event handlers
* generated code is delimited by comment markers and user is free to add additional code around and continue to use ImRAD at the same time
* generated code is ready to use in your project and depends only on ImGui library and one accompanying header file
